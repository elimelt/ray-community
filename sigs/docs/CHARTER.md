# SIG Ray Docs

## Objective

## Scope

This group supports, prioritizes, and maintains documentation-related additions within the open-source Ray repository. This group is also responsible for providing feedback on the quality of existing Ray documentation; for organizing documentation sprints; and for providing standards and guidelines for Ray open-source documentation.

Any supplemental documentation-related added functionality should fit the following criteria:

* The additions fall into the category of tutorials, guides, API documentation, or similar.
* The documentation conforms to established API patterns in Ray or its affiliate libraries (ex: Train, Serve, Datasets).
* The documentation must include unit tests, and the functionality must evolve as Ray evolves.
* The new functionality conforms to the code and documentation standards defined by the group. These policies are detailed in the Ray project's [contributor guide](https://github.com/ray-project/community/blob/main/sigs/graph-algorithms).
* The documentation is useful for a large number of users (e.g., an implementation used in widely cited paper; an example showcasing a specific scenario; or a utility with broad applicability).

## Membership

Anyone with an interest in helping extend the Ray open-source project with new types of documentation, tutorials, and examples is welcome to join the special interest group. Maintainer status for the repository will be conferred by consensus of the existing members. Archives of the SIG's meeting minutes are publicly accessible, as a GitHub issue referenced in the `docs` folder.
